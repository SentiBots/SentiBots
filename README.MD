The SentiBots project is a project aiming to achieve the perfect distributed robotic system 
platform. By providing open source files we allow the end user to modify the files as necessary 
to his/her needs. This project invovles a custom designed frame and build which creates a 
modular, optimised frame for a distributed robotic system.

This is the source files for the SentiBots project. It includes the source code, cad files, build
notes and documentation you might need.
